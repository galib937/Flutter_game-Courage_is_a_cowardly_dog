# courage_the_cowardly_dog

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)


Basically in this project I tried to make a simple game using flutter where we the player can move the character of courage to avoid all the obstacles. The detection for the obstacles has not been implemented it nor has the scoring system been made functional. Both of which I do plan on doing. I do plan to treat this as a fun little project on the side because I did love the cartoon when i was a kid.
